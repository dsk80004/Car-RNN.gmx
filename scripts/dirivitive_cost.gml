// I know there is a lot of nonsense speak here, but stop each time he introduces a new word and try to figure out how he got those values.

 cost = (output - desired_output)^2

 activation is basically just another term for output?
 activation = input * weight

 dirivitive = activation / weight = input

 this is complex way of stating a tempraroy variable which we will use to figure out which direction we should adjust to, similar to how gamemaker has the point_direction function
 first order polynomial = dirivitive * cost

var cost = argument0
var desired_output = argument1



//var dirivitive = 2*()

/// change_in_y / change_in_x = x^2
